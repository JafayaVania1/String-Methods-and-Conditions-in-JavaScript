# String-Methods-and-Conditions-in-JavaScript


## String Methods and Conditional Statements in JavaScript

---

## Project Overview

This project is part of my JavaScript learning journey, focusing on core programming concepts such as string manipulation, conditional logic, and control structures. Through this hands-on exercise, I gained practical experience writing clean and structured JavaScript code to solve common programming problems and simulate real-life scenarios.

## Key Features

- **String Methods Practice:**  
  Utilized essential string methods including `length`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `includes()`, and `charAt()` to manipulate and analyze text data.

- **Conditional Statements:**  
  Applied `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to implement decision-making logic throughout the project.

- **Password Validation System:**  
  Built a simple system to validate user passwords, demonstrating basic authentication logic.

- **Age Eligibility Check:**  
  Created functionality to verify if a user meets the minimum age requirement for voting.

- **Number Sign Identification:**  
  Developed logic to determine whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

- **Grading System:**  
  Implemented a grading system using conditional statements to categorize scores.

- **Calculator:**  
  Used `switch-case` statements to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **Day Name Display:**  
  Designed a feature that maps numeric input (1-7) to the corresponding day of the week using `switch-case`.

## How to Run

1. Open the project files in your preferred code editor.
2. Open the main `.html` file (if applicable) in a web browser.
3. Interact with the JavaScript features through the browser console or UI prompts, depending on the implementation.
4. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
